# Recipe Website - Odin Project

## Overview
This is my implementation of the first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. The goal is to build a basic recipe website using foundational HTML and Git skills. It showcases a simple, functional webpage structure with multiple recipes, demonstrating core web development concepts.

## Features
- **HTML Fundamentals**: Utilizes elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<a>`), attributes (e.g., `href`, `src`), and proper document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
- **Nesting**: Structured content with nested elements for readability and hierarchy.
- **Git Workflow**: Commits follow imperative mood convention (e.g., "Add recipe page layout"), with version control integrated throughout development.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chrome-Rabbit/recipe-website.git

## Navigation
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd recipe-website

## Opening
1. Open it in your local browser or if using linux:
    '''bash
    xdg-open index.html

## Usage
- Browse the homepage (index.html) for a list of recipes.
- Click links to view individual recipe pages.
- No additional setup required—just HTML and a browser.

## Learning Goals
This project incorporates everything I’ve learned so far in The Odin Project Foundations course, including:
- Crafting semantic HTML.
- Organizing content with nesting and hierarchy.
- Using Git for version control with clear commit messages.

# Personal Reflection 
Before starting The Odin Project, I’d built a decent skill set in game dev and IT work—coding in C#, Python, GDScript, and Bash, plus managing projects with Git. Back then, I was scripting gameplay in Godot or automating tasks in Linux, but web development was uncharted territory. This recipe site pulled me back to basics: writing HTML from scratch and dusting off my Git habits. It’s been a shift—swapping loops and logic for tags and nesting—but it’s sharpened my focus on structure and clarity. Where I am now is a pivot point: I’ve got a simple site done, a refreshed grip on Git, and a clear path to layer on CSS and JavaScript. This project’s a bridge from my past skills to a new domain.
