        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These matcha mochi are soft, chewy rice cakes with a hint of green tea and a sweet red bean filling. Lightly dusted with cornstarch, they offer a delicate balance of flavor and texture.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste</li>
            <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup cornstarch, for rolling out the dough</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid, at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a microwave-safe bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in water, then sugar; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, remove red bean paste from the freezer and divide into 8 equal balls. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Remove rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat, covered, for another 15 to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Dust a work surface with cornstarch. Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture into a ball. Flatten the ball and place one ball of frozen red bean paste in the center. Pinch and press the dough around the bean paste until completely covered.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with additional cornstarch and place mochi, seam-side down, in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Repeat Step 6 to make remaining mochi.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
