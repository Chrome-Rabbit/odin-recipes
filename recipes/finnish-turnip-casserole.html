        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Place carrot and turnip cubes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain; steam dry 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is slightly firmed and top has begun to turn golden brown, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
